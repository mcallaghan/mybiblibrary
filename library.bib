@article{Hirth2013,
abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the market value of variable renewable energy (VRE). The inherent variability of wind speeds and solar radiation affects the price that VRE generators receive on the market (market value). During windy and sunny times the additional electricity supply reduces the prices. Because the drop is larger with more installed capacity, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate. This study aims to develop a better understanding on how the market value with penetration, and how policies and prices affect the market value. Quantitative evidence is derived from a review of published studies, regression analysis of market data, and the calibrated model of the European electricity market EMMA. We find the value of wind power to fall from 110{\%} of the average power price to 50-80{\%} as wind penetration increases from zero to 30{\%} of total electricity consumption. For solar power, similarly low value levels are reached already at 15{\%} penetration. Hence, competitive large-scale renewable deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than as many anticipate. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper examines the use of interactive models of research in the US regional integrated scientific assessments (RISAS), using as a case study the climate assessment of the Southwest (CLIMAS). It focuses on three components of regional climate assessments: interdisciplinarity, interaction with stakeholders and production of usable knowledge, and on the role of three explanatory variables - the level of 'fit' between state of knowledge production and application, disciplinary and personal flexibility, and availability of resources - which affect the co-production of science and policy in the context of integrated assessments. It finds that although no single model can fulfill the multitude of goals of such assessments, it is in highly interactive models that the possibilities of higher levels of innovation and related social impact are most likely to occur. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Demand Side Response is a relatively recent solution in Europe which has the potential to reduce peak demand and ease impending capacity shortages. Peak Energy Demand and Demand Side Response presents evidence on a set of Demand Side Response activities, ranging from price-based to incentive-based programmes and policies. Examples are drawn from different programmes for both residential and non-residential sectors of electricity demand, including Time of Use tariffs, Critical Peak Pricing Automated Demand Controllers and Ancillary Services. The book also looks at the actual energy saving impacts of smart meters, the activities which constitute peak demand and the potential opportunities associated with European smart grids and Capacity Markets. This is the first book presenting comprehensive analysis of the impacts, cost benefits and risks associated with Demand Side Response programmes and policies. It should be of interest to students, scholars and policy-makers in the areas of energy, environmental economics and applied economics.},

abstract = {This paper considers two related distortions in electricity markets: the lack of real-time retail pricing and the suppression of peak wholesale prices due to Installed Capacity requirements. I lay out a framework for understanding these problems using a two-stage entry model in which producers with multiple technologies set capacity and then sell electricity into wholesale markets as demand varies over time. The model is calibrated to supply and demand conditions in the PJM electricity market. I estimate that moving from 10 percent of consumers on real-time pricing to 20 percent would increase welfare in PJM by {\$}120 million per year. However, the welfare gains from clearer signals of scarcity prices under an Energy Only market design are more than twice as large. Furthermore, equilibrium peak prices in the Energy Only design drop to reasonable levels once a moderate share of retail consumers are on real-time pricing.},

abstract = {Published research on smart homes and their users is growing exponentially, yet a clear understanding of who these users are and how they might use smart home technologies is missing from a field being overwhelmingly pushed by technology developers. Through a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature on smart homes and their users, this paper takes stock of the dominant research themes and the linkages and disconnects between them. Key findings within each of nine themes are analysed, grouped into three: (1) views of the smart home-functional, instrumental, socio-technical; (2) users and the use of the smart home-prospective users, interactions and decisions, using technologies in the home; and (3) challenges for realising the smart home-hardware and software, design, domestication. These themes are integrated into an organising framework for future research that identifies the presence or absence of cross-cutting relationships between different understandings of smart homes and their users. The usefulness of the organising framework is illustrated in relation to two major concerns-privacy and control-that have been narrowly interpreted to date, precluding deeper insights and potential solutions. Future research on smart homes and their users can benefit by exploring and developing cross-cutting relationships between the research themes identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag London.},

We calculate scores for sentences in document clusters based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model. Then, using these scores, we train a regression model based on the lexical and structural characteristics of the sentences, and use the model to score sentences of new documents to form a summary.

Unlike other recent work that relies on Markov assumptions or discretization of time, here each topic is associated with a continuous distribution over timestamps, and for each generated document, the mixture distribution over topics is influenced by both word co-occurrences and the document's timestamp. Thus, the meaning of a particular topic can be relied upon as constant, but the topics' occurrence and correlations change significantly over time. We present results on nine months of personal email, 17 years of NIPS research papers and over 200 years of presidential state-of-the-union addresses, showing improved topics, better timestamp prediction, and interpretable trends.},

The IPCC assessment also results in the separation of the Earth, Biological and Social sciences. The integration that occurs is mainly between closely related scientific fields. The research community consequently imposes a physical and economic bias and a separation of scientific fields that the IPCC reproduces in the policy sphere. It is argued that this physical and economic bias distorts a comprehensive understanding of climate change and that the weak integration of scientific fields hinders climate change from being fully addressed as an integral environmental and social problem.

abstract = {Learning meaningful topic models with massive document collections which contain millions of documents and billions of tokens is challenging because of two reasons: First, one needs to deal with a large number of topics (typically in the order of thousands). Second, one needs a scalable and efficient way of distributing the computation across multiple machines. In this paper we present a novel algorithm F+Nomad LDA which simultaneously tackles both these problems. In order to handle large number of topics we use an appropriately modified Fenwick tree. This data structure allows us to sample from a multinomial distribution over {\$}T{\$} items in {\$}O(\backslashlog T){\$} time. Moreover, when topic counts change the data structure can be updated in {\$}O(\backslashlog T){\$} time. In order to distribute the computation across multiple processor we present a novel asynchronous framework inspired by the Nomad algorithm of $\backslash$cite{\{}YunYuHsietal13{\}}. We show that F+Nomad LDA significantly outperform state-of-the-art on massive problems which involve millions of documents, billions of words, and thousands of topics.},

Technological developments will be critical, but so will accelerated adoption of promising low-emission technologies and practices. National commitments will be more achievable if interventions take into account key psychological, social, cultural and organizational factors that influence energy choices, along with factors of an infrastructural, technical and economic nature. Broader engagement of social and behavioural science is needed to identify promising opportunities for reducing fossil fuel consumption. Here we discuss opportunities for change in households and organizations, primarily at short and intermediate timescales, and identify opportunities that have been underused in much of energy policy. Based on this survey, we suggest design principles for interventions by governments and other organizations, and identify areas of emphasis for future social science and interdisciplinary research.},

abstract = {Sustainability is an important concept for society, economics, and the environment, with thousands of research papers published on the subject annually. As sustainability science becomes a distinctive research field, it is important to define sustainability clearly and grasp the entire structure, current status, and future directions of sustainability science. This paper provides an academic landscape of sustainability science by analyzing the citation network of papers published in academic journals. A topological clustering method is used to detect the subdomains of sustainability science. Results show the existence of 15 main research clusters: Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, Forestry (agroforestry), Forestry (tropical rain forest), Business, Tourism, Water, Forestry (biodiversity), Urban Planning, Rural Sociology, Energy, Health, Soil, and Wildlife. Agriculture, Fisheries, Ecological Economics, and Forestry (agroforestry) clusters are predominant among these. The Energy cluster is currently developing, as indicated by the age of papers in the cluster, although it has a relatively small number of papers. These results are compared with those obtained by natural language processing. Education, Biotechnology, Medical, Livestock, Climate Change, Welfare, and Livelihood clusters are uniquely extracted by natural language processing, because they are common topics across clusters in the citation network.},

abstract = {In order to meet stringent temperature targets, active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere may be required in the long run. Such negative emissions can be materialized when well-performing bioenergy systems are combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Here, we develop an integrated global energy system and climate model to evaluate the role of BECCS in reaching ambitious temperature targets. We present emission, concentration and temperature pathways towards 1.5 and 2 ° C targets. Our model results demonstrate that BECCS makes it feasible to reach temperature targets that are otherwise out of reach, provided that a temporary overshoot of the target is accepted. Additionally, stringent temperature targets can be met at considerably lower cost if BECCS is available. However, the economic benefit of BECCS nearly vanishes if an overshoot of the temperature target is not allowed. Finally, the least-cost emission pathway over the next 50 years towards a 1.5 ° C overshoot target with BECCS is almost identical to a pathway leading to a 2 ° C ceiling target. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Findings highlight that TOU tariffs bring about higher average electricity consumption and lower payments by consumers. A significant level of load shifting takes place for morning peaks. However, issues with evening peaks are not resolved. Finally, TOU tariffs lead to increases in electricity demand for substations at peak time. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Postnormal science is appropriate when either attribute is high; then the traditional methodologies are ineffective. In those circumstances, the quality assurance of scientific inputs to the policy process requires an 'extended peer community', consisting of all those with a stake in the dialogue on the issue.

As a crisis discipline, conservation science is particularly in need of tools that facilitate rapid yet insightful synthesis. We show how a common text-mining method (latent Dirichlet allocation, or topic modeling) and statistical tests familiar to ecologists (cluster analysis, regression, and network analysis) can be used to investigate trends and identify potential research gaps in the scientific literature. We tested these methods on the literature on ecological surrogates and indicators. Analysis of topic popularity within this corpus showed a strong emphasis on monitoring and management of fragmented ecosystems, while analysis of research gaps suggested a greater role for genetic surrogates and indicators. Our results show that automated text analysis methods need to be used with care, but can provide information that is complementary to that given by systematic reviews and meta-analyses, increasing scientists' capacity for research synthesis.

We derive an efficient variational approximate inference algorithm that takes advantage of the sparsity of observations in text, a property that lets us easily han- dle many time points. In contrast to the cDTM, the original discrete-time dynamic topic model (dDTM) requires that time be discretized. Moreover, the complexity of vari- ational inference for the dDTM grows quickly as time granularity increases, a drawback which limits fne-grained discretization. We demonstrate the cDTM on two news corpora, reporting both predictive perplexity and the novel task of time stamp prediction.},

abstract = {The concepts of sustainable development have experienced extraordinary success since their advent in the 1980s. They are now an integral part of the agenda of governments and corporations, and their goals have become central to the mission of research laboratories and universities worldwide. However, it remains unclear how far the field has progressed as a scientific discipline, especially given its ambitious agenda of integrating theory, applied science, and policy, making it relevant for development globally and generating a new interdisciplinary synthesis across fields. To address these questions, we assembled a corpus of scholarly publications in the field and analyzed its temporal evolution, geographic distribution, disciplinary composition, and collaboration structure. We show that sustainability science has been growing explosively since the late 1980s when foundational publications in the field increased its pull on new authors and intensified their interactions. The field has an unusual geographic footprint combining contributions and connecting through collaboration cities and nations at very different levels of development. Its decomposition into traditional disciplines reveals its emphasis on the management of human, social, and ecological systems seen primarily from an engineering and policy perspective. Finally, we show that the integration of these perspectives has created a new field only in recent years as judged by the emergence of a giant component of scientific collaboration. These developments demonstrate the existence of a growing scientific field of sustainability science as an unusual, inclusive and ubiquitous scientific practice and bode well for its continued impact and longevity.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates a large-scale pilot program run by a company called OPOWER, previ- ously known as Positive Energy, to mail home energy use reports to residential utility consumers. The reports include energy conservation information as well as social comparisons between a household's energy use and that of its neighbors. Using data from a randomized natural {\ldots}eld ex- periment at 80,000 treatment and control households in Minnesota, I estimate that the monthly program reduces energy consumption by 1.9 to 2.0 percent relative to baseline. In a treatment arm receiving reports each quarter, the e¤ects decay over the months between letters and in- crease again upon receipt of the next letter. I provide evidence to suggest that at least some of this e¤ect is because consumers'attention is malleable and non-durable. I show that “pro{\ldots}ling,” or using a statistical decision rule to target the program at households whose observable charac- teristics predict larger treatment e¤ects, could substantially improve cost e¤ectiveness in future programs. The results provide additional evidence that non-price “nudges”can substantially a¤ect consumer behavior.},

abstract = {The past five years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of media and scientific publications on the topic of climate engineering, or geoengineering, and some scientists are increasingly calling for more research on climate engineering as a possible supplement to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. In this context, understanding the current state of climate engineering research can help inform policy discussions and guide future research directions. Bibliometric analysis—the quantitative analysis of publications—is particularly applicable to fields with large bodies of literature that are difficult to summarize by traditional review methods. The multidisciplinary nature of the published literature on climate engineering makes it an ideal candidate for bibliometric analysis. Publications on climate engineering are found to be relatively recent (more than half of all articles during 1988–2011 were published since 2008), include a higher than average percentage of nonresearch articles (30{\%} compared with 8–15{\%} in related scientific disciplines), and be predominately produced by countries located in the Northern Hemisphere and speaking English. The majority of this literature focuses on land-based methods of carbon sequestration, ocean iron fertilization, and solar radiation management and is produced with little collaboration among research groups. This study provides a summary of existing publications on climate engineering, a perspective on the scientific underpinnings of the global dialogue on climate engineering, and  a baseline for quantitatively monitoring the development of climate engineering research in the future.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based medicine depends on the timely synthesis of research findings. An important source of synthesized evidence resides in systematic reviews. However, a bottleneck in review production involves dual screening of citations with titles and abstracts to find eligible studies. For this research, we tested the effect of various kinds of textual information (features) on performance of a machine learning classifier. Based on our findings, we propose an automated system to reduce screeing burden, as well as offer quality assurance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We built a database of citations from 5 systematic reviews that varied with respect to domain, topic, and sponsor. Consensus judgments regarding eligibility were inferred from published reports. We extracted 5 feature sets from citations: alphabetic, alphanumeric(+), indexing, features mapped to concepts in systematic reviews, and topic models. To simulate a two-person team, we divided the data into random halves. We optimized the parameters of a Bayesian classifier, then trained and tested models on alternate data halves. Overall, we conducted 50 independent tests.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All tests of summary performance (mean F3) surpassed the corresponding baseline, P{\textless}0.0001. The ranks for mean F3, precision, and classification error were statistically different across feature sets averaged over reviews; P-values for Friedman's test were .045, .002, and .002, respectively. Differences in ranks for mean recall were not statistically significant. Alphanumeric(+) features were associated with best performance; mean reduction in screening burden for this feature type ranged from 88{\%} to 98{\%} for the second pass through citations and from 38{\%} to 48{\%} overall.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A computer-assisted, decision support system based on our methods could substantially reduce the burden of screening citations for systematic review teams and solo reviewers. Additionally, such a system could deliver quality assurance both by confirming concordant decisions and by naming studies associated with discordant decisions for further consideration.},

With the rollout of smart metres and the availability of more fine-grained energy monitoring equipment for the workplace, it is increasingly possible to disaggregate collective energy consumption and apportion this among building users. This article presents an interdisciplinary perspective on the rationale and feasibility of different approaches to apportionment to motivate staff to reduce energy consumption. Our review indicates greatest potential for energy saving when consumption is apportioned to small to medium-sized groups, rather than individuals or entire buildings, particularly when they represent existing communities to which staff members strongly identify. We highlight the complexity of technical, psychological, social and organisational factors that not only inspire, but also often confound, efforts to innovate in this area.},

This paper reviews and synthesises empirical evidence to identify what types of behaviour change intervention are most successful at saving energy in an office-type workplace. We draw on the field of health-related behaviour change interventions and adopt the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie et al., 2014) as a framework through which to assess the success of the interventions reviewed here (n = 22 studies). We find that interventions creating social and physical opportunities for employees to save energy are the most successful i.e. which constitute Enablement (including direct support and greater control to employees), Environmental Restructuring (particularly automated and retrofitted technologies) and Modelling (various forms of social influence). The communal nature of most workplaces demands scrutiny to understand the effect of social influences. We provide recommendations for future research, including the need to consider forms of intervention not yet researched; Coercion, Restriction, and Training. We conclude by calling for further, well evaluated, energy saving behavioural interventions in a variety of workplaces to identify those techniques which offer the greatest success in saving energy and thus reducing carbon emissions.},

The global climate policy and SDG agendas are highly interconnected: the way that the climate problem is addressed strongly affects the prospects of meeting numerous other SDGs and vice versa. Drawing on existing scenario results from a recent energy-economy-climate model inter-comparison project, this letter analyses these synergies and (risk) trade-offs of alternative 2 °C pathways across indicators relevant for energy-related SDGs and sustainable energy objectives. We find that limiting the availability of key mitigation technologies yields some co-benefits and decreases risks specific to these technologies but greatly increases many others. Fewer synergies and substantial trade-offs across SDGs are locked into the system for weak short-term climate policies that are broadly in line with current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), particularly when combined with constraints on technologies. Lowering energy demand growth is key to managing these trade-offs and creating synergies across multiple energy-related SD dimensions. We argue that SD considerations are central for choosing socially acceptable 2 °C pathways: the prospects of meeting other SDGs need not dwindle and can even be enhanced for some goals if appropriate climate policy choices are made. Progress on the climate policy and SDG agendas should therefore be tracked within a unified framework.},

We contribute to the understanding of public views on climate change and to knowledge needed by decision-makers by using a new approach to analyse answers to the open survey question ' what comes to mind when you hear the words ' climate change' ?'. We apply automated text analysis, specifically structural topic modelling, which induces distinct topics based on the relative frequencies of the words used in 2,115 responses. From these data, originating from the new, nationally representative Norwegian Citizen Panel, four distinct topics emerge: Weather/Ice, Future/Impact, Money/Consumption and Attribution. We find that Norwegians emphasize societal aspects of climate change more than do respondents in previous US and UK studies. Furthermore, variables that explain variation in closed questions, such as gender and education, yield different and surprising results when employed to explain variation in what respondents emphasize. Finally, the sharp distinction between scepticism and acceptance of conventional climate science, often seen in previous studies, blurs in many textual responses as scepticism frequently turns into ambivalence.},

abstract = {Sudden, unprecedented electric blackouts and outages come as a dampener for a system that thrives on electrical energy. Reliability and efficiency are essential features for any power grid system. The conventional power grid systems are incapable of making use of real-time information from consumer side as well as the supply end for a more efficient transmission. Smart grid system, in which tremendous research has been done and which has been improvised manifold over the past decade, helps in meeting the incessant fluctuations in power demand from a huge consumer population. Smart grid brings about automation in managing the energy requirements using a two way interactive system, i.e. its ability to fetch information from the user and supply ends and utilize it to improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the transmission lines. Incorporating smart energy meters along with smart grid could come a long way in conserving electricity apart from removing manual energy meter reading from the scene. Smart meters supply the required data for the smart grid which helps the grid in providing an automated response. The paper elucidates how smart meters help in digitally tackling the issue of energy conservation in the consumer end and the utility end.},

Fewer synergies and substantial trade-offs across SDGs are locked into the system for weak short-term climate policies that are broadly in line with current Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), particularly when combined with constraints on technologies. Lowering energy demand growth is key to managing these trade-offs and creating synergies across multiple energy-related SD dimensions. We argue that SD considerations are central for choosing socially acceptable 2 °C pathways: The prospects of meeting other SDGs need not dwindle and can even be enhanced for some goals if appropriate climate policy choices are made. Progress on the climate policy and SDG agendas should therefore be tracked within a unified framework.},

@article{Cohen2010,
abstract = {High quality, cost-effective medical care requires consideration of the best available, most appropriate evidence in the care of each patient, a practice known as Evidence-based Medicine (EBM). EBM is dependent upon the wide availability and coverage of accurate, objective syntheses called evidence reports (also called systematic reviews). These are compiled by a time and resourceintensive process that is largely manual, and that has not taken advantage of many of the advances in information processing technologies that have assisted other textual domains. We propose a specific text-mining based pipeline to support the creation and updating of evidence reports that provides support for the literature collection, collation, and triage steps of the systematic review process. The pipeline includes a metasearch engine that covers both bibliographic databases and selected “grey” literature; a module that classifies articles according to study type; a module for grouping studies that are closely related (e.g. that derive from the same underlying clinical trial or same study cohort); and an automated system that ranks publications according to the likelihood that they will meet inclusion criteria for the report. The proposed pipeline will also enable groups performing systematic review to reuse tools and models created by other groups, and will provide a test-bed for further informatics research to develop improved tools in the future. Ultimately, this should increase the rate that high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be generated, accessed and utilized by clinicians, patients, caregivers, and policymakers, resulting in better and more costeffective care.},

abstract = {As massive repositories of real-time human commentary, social media platforms have arguably evolved far beyond passive facilitation of online social interactions. Rapid analysis of information content in online social media streams (news articles, blogs,tweets etc.) is the need of the hour as it allows business and government bodies to understand public opinion about products and policies. In most of these settings, data points appear as a stream of high dimensional feature vectors. Guided by real-world industrial deployment scenarios, we revisit the problem of online learning of topics from streaming social media content. On one hand, the topics need to be dynamically adapted to the statistics of incoming datapoints, and on the other hand, early detection of rising new trends is important in many applications. We propose an online nonnegative matrix factorization framework to capture the evolution and emergence of themes in unstructured text under a novel temporal regularization framework. We develop scalable optimization algorithms for our framework, propose a new set of evaluation metrics, and report promising empirical results on traditional TDT tasks as well as streaming Twitter data. Our system is able to rapidly capture emerging themes, track existing topics over time while maintaining temporal consistency and continuity in user views, and can be explicitly configured to bound the amount of information being presented to the user.},

abstract = {Most US consumers are charged a near-constant retail price for electricity, despite substantial hourly variation in the wholesale market price. This paper evaluates a randomized experiment that exposed households to hourly real time pricing (RTP) and applies the demand estimates to counterfactual simulations in a structural model of the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland electricity market. The model includes a dierent approach to the problem of multiple equilibria in multi-unit auctions: I non-parametrically estimate unobservables that rationalize past bidding behavior and use learning algorithms to move from the observed equilibrium counterfactual bid functions. This routine is nested as the second stage of a static entry model that captures an important institution called the Capacity Market, which acts in equilibrium as a minimum constraint on system capacity and transfers the shadow price to capacity owners. There are four central results. First, the experimentis net eect on consumer behavior was energy conservation during peak hours, not substitution from peak to o-peak. Second, I detail plausible conditions under which large scale RTP could actually increase wholesale electricity prices in peak hours, contrary to predictions from short run models, while decreasing Capacity Market prices and total entry. Third, although the increased demand elasticity from RTP reduces producersimarket power, in practice this would be a second-order channel of efficiency gains. Fourth, I Ond that the welfare gains from residential RTP are likely, but not certain, to outweigh the costs of the required hourly electricity meters.},

abstract = {—Much research has been devoted to topic detection from text, but one major challenge has not been addressed: revealing the rich relationships that exist among the detected topics. Finding such relationships is important since many applications are interested in how topics come into being, how they develop, grow, disintegrate, and finally disappear. In this paper, we present a novel method that reveal the inter-connections among topics discovered from the text data. Specifically, our method focuses on how one topic splits into multiple topics, and how multiple topics merge into one topic. We adopt the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model, and propose an incremental Gibbs sampling algorithm to incrementally derive and refine the labels of clusters. We then characterize the splitting and merging patterns among clusters based on how labels change. We propose a global analysis process that focuses on cluster splitting and merging, and a finer-granularity analysis process that helps users to better understand the content of the clusters and the evolution patterns. We also develop a visualization to present the results.},

The multi-level nature of such problems has required a radical shift in the relationship between knowledge and action. This working paper illustrates that in an era of global change which is inexorably linked with local ecosystems and communities, successful efforts of regional assessments which address large-scale environmental change can be characterized as distributed research, assessment, and decision support systems. Such systems share a number of characteristics. They: 1) integrate research, assessment, and decision-making across multiple levels; 2) are structured to assess and address global change in the context of local consequences; 3) identify, assess, and respond to the interactions between society and environment which cross levels; and 4) structure the relationship between decision-makers and researchers as a two-way, dynamic, and iterated process (not a "pipeline" from science to decision-maker).},

@article{Rogelj2013,
abstract = {For more than a decade, the target of keeping global warming below 2 °C has been a key focus of the international climate debate. In response, the scientific community has published a number of scenario studies that estimate the costs of achieving such a target. Producing these estimates remains a challenge, particularly because of relatively well known, but poorly quantified, uncertainties, and owing to limited integration of scientific knowledge across disciplines. The integrated assessment community, on the one hand, has extensively assessed the influence of technological and socio-economic uncertainties on low-carbon scenarios and associated costs. The climate modelling community, on the other hand, has spent years improving its understanding of the geophysical response of the Earth system to emissions of greenhouse gases. This geophysical response remains a key uncertainty in the cost of mitigation scenarios but has been integrated with assessments of other uncertainties in only a rudimentary manner, that is, for equilibrium conditions. Here we bridge this gap between the two research communities by generating distributions of the costs associated with limiting transient global temperature increase to below specific values, taking into account uncertainties in four factors: geophysical, technological, social and political. We find that political choices that delay mitigation have the largest effect on the cost-risk distribution, followed by geophysical uncertainties, social factors influencing future energy demand and, lastly, technological uncertainties surrounding the availability of greenhouse gas mitigation options. Our information on temperature risk and mitigation costs provides crucial information for policy-making, because it clarifies the relative importance of mitigation costs, energy demand and the timing of global action in reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature increase of 2 °C, or other limits such as 3 °C or 1.5 °C, across a wide range of scenarios.},

abstract = {Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discover-ing topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational ap-proximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics. This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based O(1) sampler for topic assign-ments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical re-sults show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity.},

abstract = {The smart metering systems currently being installed in UK households support devices that give feedback aimed at encouraging behaviour changes, specifically to reduce energy demand and spending on energy. Detailed standards specify the minimum technical capabilities of the smart meters and feedback devices. In this paper, we assess the extent to which these standards enable feedback that is likely to be effective in reducing demand. Latest research in this field, drawing on theories of social practice, suggests that feedback devices assume and rely on what we term ‘reflection practice', a distinctive type of social practice, and that feedback attentive to the particular energy-using practices of householders is likely to have most influence on demand. Neither the smart meter standards nor current commercial devices are found to incorporate these latest research findings, potentially significantly limiting the ability of the UK smart metering programme to fulfil its domestic energy demand reduction object...},

abstract = {How can assessments of environmental policy issues be policy-relevant without being policy-prescriptive? The predominant technocratic and decisionist responses to this question misleadingly assume that value-neutral scientific recommendations for public policy means, or even objectives, are possible. On the other end of the spectrum, the literature on democratic and pragmatic models of expertise in policy often does not satisfactorily explain what researchers can contribute to public discourses surrounding disputed, value-laden policy objectives and means. Building on John Dewey's philosophy, this article develops the "pragmatic-enlightened model" (PEM) of assessment making, which refines the existing pragmatic models. It is used to some extent by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to the PEM's policy assessment methodology, policy objectives and their means can only be evaluated in light of the practical consequences of the means. Learning about the secondary effects, side effects and synergies of the best means may require a revaluation of the policy objectives, for instance, regarding the use of bioenergy for climate mitigation. Following the PEM, assessments would-based on a thorough problem analysis-explore alternative policy pathways, including their diverse practical consequences, overlaps and trade-offs, in cooperation with stakeholders. Such an arduous interdisciplinary cartography of multiple objectives, multi-functional policy means and the broad range of their quantitative and qualitative practical consequences may face considerable practical challenges and uncertainty. Yet, it could make assessments more policy-relevant and less prescriptive, and could effectively support a learning process about the political solution space.},

abstract = {Within the next years, consumer households will be increasingly equipped with smart metering and intelligent appliances. These technologies are the basis for households to better monitor electricity consumption and to actively control loads in private homes. Demand side management (DSM) can be adopted to private households. We present a simulation model that generates household load profiles under flat tariffs and simulates changes in these profiles when households are equipped with smart appliances and face time-based electricity prices.We investigate the impact of smart appliances and variable prices on electricity bills of a household. We show that for households the savings from equipping them with smart appliances are moderate compared to the required investment. This finding is quite robust with respect to variation of tariff price spreads and to different types of appliance utilization patterns.Finally, our results indicate that electric utilities may face new demand peaks when day-ahead hourly prices are applied. However, a considerable amount of residential load is available for shifting, which is interesting for the utilities to balance demand and supply. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {EDRP was a major project in Great Britain to test consumers responses to different forms of information about their energy use. Four energy suppliers each conducted trials of the impacts of various interventions (individually or in combination) between 2007 and 2010. The interventions used were primarily directed at reducing domestic energy consumption, with a minority focused on shifting energy use from periods of peak demand. The project involved over 60,000 households, including 18,000 with smart meters. Measures were generally applied at household level but one supplier also tested action at community level. The final analysis collates and builds on suppliers findings and additional analysis of the data on energy consumption and consumer feedback, together with a review of the wider literature to identify the interventions that have proved most effective in reducing consumption, and key messages about how such interventions can best be delivered. The report provides a unique source of information particularly pertinent to the forthcoming national roll- out of smart meters. It sets out the quantitative savings that were achieved through a range of interventions enabled by smart meters, demonstrating the potential of smart metering as an enabling platform for measures to influence consumer behaviour.},

Evidence-gap maps are thematic evidence collections covering a range of issues such as maternal health, HIV/AIDS, and agriculture. They present a visual overview of existing systematic reviews or impact evaluations in a sector or subsector, schematically representing the types of interventions evaluated and outcomes reported. Gap maps enable policy makers and practitioners to explore the findings and quality of the existing evidence and facilitate informed judgment and evidence-based decision making in international development policy and practice. The gap map also identifies key"gaps"where little or no evidence from impact evaluations and systematic reviews is available and where future research should be focused. Thus, gap maps can be a useful tool for developing a strategic approach to building the evidence base in a particular sector. This paper provides an introduction to evidence-gap maps, outlines the gap-map methodology, and presents some examples.},

abstract = {In-home displays, dynamic pricing, and automated devices aim to reduce residential electricity use-overall and during peak hours. We present a meta-analysis of 32 studies of the impacts of these interventions, conducted in the US or Canada. We find that methodological problems are common in the design of these studies, leading to artificially inflated results relative to what one would expect if the interventions were implemented in the general population. Particular problems include having volunteer participants who may have been especially motivated to reduce their electricity use, letting participants choose their preferred intervention, and having high attrition rates. Using estimates of bias from medical clinical trials as a guide, we recalculate impact estimates to adjust for bias, resulting in values that are often less than half of those reported in the reviewed studies. We estimate that in-home displays were the most effective intervention for reducing overall electricity use ({\~{}}. 4{\%} using reported data; {\~{}}. 3{\%} after adjusting for bias), while dynamic pricing significantly reduced peak demand ({\~{}}. 11{\%} reported; {\~{}}. 6{\%} adjusted), especially when used in conjunction with home automation ({\~{}}. 25{\%} reported; {\~{}}. 14{\%} adjusted).

@article{Nunez-Mir2016,
abstract = {1. The exponential growth of scientific literature – which we call the ‘big literature' phenomenon – has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditionalmanual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesismethods to address this challenge. 2. In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences andinmedical research. 3. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists toACAand illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First,we provide a brief history of theACAmethod and summarize the fun- damental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally,we discuss how tomaximize the utility and contribu- tionsofACA,aswellaspotential research directions that may help to advance the use ofACAin future ecologi- cal and evolutionary research. 4. Unlikemanualmethods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substan- tially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to addressmore targeted research questions. By allowing formore exten- sive and comprehensive reviews of big literature,ACAhas the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.},

abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {Electricity prices that describe marginal costs can vary substantially over time. Fixed rates ignore changing electricity system conditions. Setting prices that differ for certain periods is an approach to approximating the real-time price. If such time-of-use prices are set in advance, they will necessarily miss the full variability of real real-time prices. A simple index indicates that even very good time-of-use rates would miss the majority of the efficiency gain that would result with use of actual real-time prices.},

abstract = {We present a study that developed and tested three query expansion methods for the retrieval of clinical documents. Finding relevant documents in a large clinical data warehouse is a challenging task. To address this issue, first, we implemented a synonym expansion strategy that used a few selected vocabularies. Second, we trained a topic model on a large set of clinical documents, which was then used to identify related terms for query expansion. Third, we obtained related terms from a large predicate database derived from Medline abstracts for query expansion. The three expansion methods were tested on a set of clinical notes. All three methods successfully achieved higher average recalls and average F-measures when compared with the baseline method. The average precisions and precision at 10, however, decreased with all expansions. Amongst the three expansion methods, the topic model-based method performed the best in terms of recall and F-measure.},

When we wake up in the morning, we check our e-mail, make a quick phone call, walk outside (our movements captured by a high definition video camera), get on the bus (swiping our RFID mass transit cards) or drive (using a transponder to zip through the tolls). We arrive at the airport, making sure to purchase a sandwich with a credit card before boarding the plane, and check our BlackBerries shortly before takeoff. Or we visit the doctor or the car mechanic, generating digital records of what our medical or automotive problems are. We post blog entries confiding to the world our thoughts and feelings, or maintain personal social network profiles revealing our friendships and our tastes. Each of these transactions leaves digital breadcrumbs which, when pulled together, offer increasingly comprehensive pictures of both individuals and groups, with the potential of transforming our understanding of our lives, organizations, and societies in a fashion that was barely conceivable just a few years ago.},

@article{Darby2006a,
abstract = {Most domestic energy use, most of the time, is invisible to the user. Most people have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes and what sort of difference they could make by changing day-to-day behaviour or investing in efficiency measures. Hence the importance of feedback in making energy more visible and more amenable to understanding and control. This review considers what is known about the effectiveness of feedback to householders. The focus is on how people change their behaviour, not on the detail of the technology used. There is considerable variety in the feedback literature, but common themes emerge. The first studies, in the 1970s, established that feedback (mostly via display monitors) has measurable effects and was worth pursuing, on its own or in combination with other processes. Feedback came to be seen in terms of a learning tool, allowing energy users to teach themselves through experimentation. Overall, the literature demonstrates that clear feedback is a necessary element in learning how to control fuel use more effectively over a long period of time and that instantaneous direct feedback in combination with frequent, accurate billing (a form of indirect feedback) is needed as a basis for sustained demand reduction. Thus feedback is useful on its own, as a self- teaching tool. It is also clear that it improves the effectiveness of other information and advice in achieving better understanding and control of energy use.},

We ap- ply unsupervised topic modeling to the ACL Anthology to analyze historical trends in the field of Computational Linguistics from 1978 to 2006. We induce topic clusters using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and examine the strength of each topic over time. Our methods find trends in the field including the rise of prob- abilistic methods starting in 1988, a steady in- crease in applications, and a sharp decline of research in semantics and understanding be- tween 1978 and 2001, possibly rising again after 2001. We also introduce a model of the diversity of ideas, topic entropy, using it to show that COLING is a more diverse confer- ence than ACL, but that both conferences as well as EMNLP are becoming broader over time. Finally, we apply Jensen-Shannon di- vergence of topic distributions to show that all three conferences are converging in the topics they cover.},
